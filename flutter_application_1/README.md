example repository: https://github.com/mahdinazmi/Flutter-Basics

## KnowHow

* To update resources use terminal
```bash 
flutter pub get
```

* We use more strict custom linter rules in the [`analysis_options.yml`](./analysis_options.yaml) https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules

* TODO: Avoid `IntrinsicHeight` by any means **(High Priority)**
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57328378/what-is-the-alternative-to-intrinsicheight-in-flutter

* Remember to use Trailing commas **(Normal Priority)**
https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/formatting

* Use `SizeBox` instead on `Container` **(Low Priority)**

* To see run errors look at DEBUG CONSOLE.

## TODO

- [ ] Popular section
- Ask how we handle cases when we have and do not have a gradient depending on selection. because we shose the initilizer that has a gradient property, we kinda should provide it... the code looks not clear in that case.
